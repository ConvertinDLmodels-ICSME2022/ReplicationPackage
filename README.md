# An Empirical Study of Challenges in Converting DL Models
This Replication Package is intended for replication of results presented in the paper "An Empirical Study of Challenges in Converting Deep Learning Models'' submitted to ICSME2022 in April 2022. It contains the data, and our detailed results presented in the paper.

Our replication package consists of two main folders: 1, 2, and Artifacts.

## Conversion
This folder contains detailed results of training and then converting models to ONNX and CoreML: prediction accuracy, running time, and memory consumption.

## Robustness
This folder contains the data used to evaluate the robustness of our models (original and converted) and the results obtained.
