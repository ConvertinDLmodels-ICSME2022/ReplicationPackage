# An Empirical Study of Challenges in Converting DL Models
This Replication Package is intended for replication of results presented in the paper "An Empirical Study of Challenges in Converting Deep Learning Models'' submitted to ICSME2022 in April 2022. It contains the data, and our detailed results presented in the paper.

Our replication package consists of two main folders: 1, 2, and Artifacts.

## Training and Converting Models
This folder contains detailed results of trained and the converted models to ONNX and CoreML: prediction accuracy, running time, and memory consumption.

## Robustness of Converted Models
This folder contains the data used to evaluate the robustness of our trained models and the results obtained.
